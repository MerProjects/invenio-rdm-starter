# InvenioRDM Starter

![Screenshot](assets/screenshot.png)

## Introduction

InvenioRDM is the turn-key research data management platform. Detailed documentation is available [here](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch). InvenioRDM Starter allows easy deployment and configuration of InvenioRDM, which allows enables running InvenioRDM on your local computer in 15 min. This is achieved by providing

* a prebuilt Invenio-App-RDM Docker image.
* a Docker Compose configuration file with sensible defaults.

InvenioRDM Starter is coordinated by the InvenioRDM partner [Front Matter](https://front-matter.io).

## Requirements

* Docker Desktop ([Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)) or Docker Engine ([Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))

A local installation of Python or Invenio-CLI is not required. A git client is recommended but not required.

## Quickstart

Download the `docker-compose.yml` file from the [InvenioRDM Starter git repository](https://github.com/front-matter/invenio-rdm-starter). Alternatively, clone the repository with git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/front-matter/invenio-rdm-starter.git
```

```bash
cd invenio-rdm-starter
```

Run `docker-compose up` in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker compose up
```

Open a web browser and navigate to [https://localhost](https://localhost).

## Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` configuration can be modified to suit your needs. The following environment variables can be set via an `.env` file in the same folder:

### Web and Worker

* `INVENIO_SITE_UI_URL` - The site UI URL used by InvenioRDM.
* `INVENIO_SITE_API_URL` - The site API URL used by InvenioRDM.
* `INVENIO_THEME_FRONTPAGE_TITLE` - The frontpage title used by InvenioRDM.
* `INVENIO_THEME_SHOW_FRONTPAGE_INTRO_SECTION` - Set to `true` to show the frontpage intro section.
* `INVENIO_LOGGING_CONSOLE_LEVEL` - The logging console level used by InvenioRDM.
* `INVENIO_BABEL_DEFAULT_LOCALE` - The default locale used by InvenioRDM.
* `INVENIO_WSGI_PROXIES` - The number of proxies used by InvenioRDM.
* `INVENIO_SITE_UI_URL` - The site UI URL used by InvenioRDM.
* `INVENIO_SITE_API_URL` - The site API URL used by InvenioRDM.
* `INVENIO_SECRET_KEY` - The secret key used by InvenioRDM.
* `INVENIO_BASE_URL` - The base URL used by InvenioRDM.

### Cache

* `INVENIO_CACHE_TYPE` - The cache type used by InvenioRDM.
* `INVENIO_CACHE_REDIS_URL` - The cache Redis URL used by InvenioRDM.
* `INVENIO_ACCOUNTS_SESSION_REDIS_URL` - The accounts session Redis URL used by InvenioRDM.
* `INVENIO_CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` - The Celery result backend used by InvenioRDM.
* `INVENIO_RATELIMIT_STORAGE_URL` - The ratelimit storage URL used by InvenioRDM.
* `INVENIO_COMMUNITIES_IDENTITIES_CACHE_REDIS_URL` - The communities identities cache Redis URL used by InvenioRDM.
* `INVENIO_BROKER_URL` - The broker URL used by InvenioRDM.
* `INVENIO_CELERY_BROKER_URL` - The Celery broker URL used by InvenioRDM.

### Database

### Search

* `INVENIO_SEARCH_HOSTS` - The search host and port.

### Mail

## Architecture

InvenioRDM Starter differs from the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` generated by
the `invenio-cli` command-line tool in the following ways:

* `invenio-cli`, a local Python installation, and a Python virtual environment are not used on the host computer.
* The [invenio-app-rdm](https://github.com/front-matter/invenio-rdm-starter/pkgs/container/invenio-rdm-starter) prebuilt Docker image provided by InvenioRDM Starter is used instead of building the image locally.
* [Debian Bookworm](https://www.debian.org/releases/bookworm/) is used as the Docker image Linux distribution instead of `Almalinux`.
* The Docker image uses `Python 3.12` (not `3.9`) and `Node 20` (not `18`).
* The Docker image uses `gunicorn` as the WSGI server instead of `uwsgi`.
* Docker Compose uses `Caddy` as the reverse proxy server instead of `Nginx`. InvenioRDM Starter will run locally at `https://localhost`, and uses a self-signed ssl certificate issued by `Caddy`.
* Docker Compose uses `Redis` as the message broker instead of `RabbitMQ`
