This is achieved by providing a prebuilt Invenio-App-RDM Docker image. a Docker Compose configuration file with sensible defaults. Requirements Docker Desktop ( Windows , macOS , Linux ) or Docker Engine ( Linux ) A local installation of Python or Invenio-CLI is not required. A git client is recommended but not required. Quickstart Download the docker-compose.yml file from the InvenioRDM Starter git repository . Alternatively, clone the repository. Run docker-compose up in the same directory as the docker-compose.yml file. Open a web browser and navigate to https://localhost . Technology Choices InvenioRDM Starter differs from the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml generated by the invenio-cli command-line tool in the following ways: invenio-cli is not used. The invenio-app-rdm Docker prebuilt image provided by InvenioRDM Starter is used instead of building the image locally. Debian Bookworm is used as the Docker base image, instead of Almalinux . The Docker image uses Python 3.12 and Node 20 . The Docker image uses gunicorn as the WSGI server instead of uwsgi . Docker Compose uses Caddy as the reverse proxy server instead of Nginx . InvenioRDM Starter will run locally at https://localhost , and uses a self-signed certificate issued by Caddy . Docker Compose uses Redis as the message broker instead of RabbitMQ","title":"Welcome to InvenioRDM Starter"},{"location":"#welcome-to-inveniordm-starter","text":"","title":"Welcome to InvenioRDM Starter"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"InvenioRDM Starter is an implementation of the InvenioRDM Turn-key research data management repository focusing on easy deployment and configuration.
